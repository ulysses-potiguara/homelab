# Thermal Throttling
Custom thermal throttling scripts for optimizing passive cooling on Intel CPUs with NTFY integration.

Controls:
- Power Clamp at cur_state
- Turbo at no_turbo
- Max frequency at scaling_max_freq
- Min frequency at scaling_min_freq
- Governor at scaling_governor
- TDP at constraint_0_power_limit_uw (PL1)
- Burst TDP at constraint_1_power_limit_uw (PL2)
